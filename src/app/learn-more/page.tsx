                  During my years of hostel life, I have had countless
                  late-night conversations with friends battling emotional
                  stress, anxiety, and depression‚Äîoften in silence. Many of
                  them, including myself, have felt the pressing need to talk
                  to someone who could simply listen, offer thoughtful advice,
                  or help navigate a tough moment‚Äîespecially during exam time
                  or periods of academic pressure.

                  In our hectic schedules, reaching out to a professional
