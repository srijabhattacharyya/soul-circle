                During my years of hostel life, I have had countless
                late-night conversations with friends battling emotional
                stress, anxiety, and depression‚Äîoften in silence. Many of
                them, including myself, have felt the pressing need to talk
                to someone who could simply listen, offer thoughtful advice,
                or help navigate a tough moment‚Äîespecially during exam time
                or periods of academic pressure.

                In our hectic schedules, reaching out to a professional
                counsellor isn‚Äôt always possible. This realization gave
                birth to SoulCircle‚Äîan AI-powered mental wellness companion
                that offers a non-judgmental, empathetic space to talk,
                reflect, and feel heard‚Äîanytime, anywhere. The AI
                counsellors in SoulCircle are available 24x7 to support
                users through conversation, journaling, self-help tools, and
                mood tracking.

                This version of SoulCircle is a prototype, but it lays the
                foundation for what could evolve into a highly personalized
                emotional wellness platform. Like all AI systems, these models
                improve over time‚Äîespecially through interaction, learning from
                real-life use cases, and user feedback. With thoughtful use and
                continuous training on ethical, anonymized data, the AI
                counsellors will become more intuitive and emotionally
                responsive.
