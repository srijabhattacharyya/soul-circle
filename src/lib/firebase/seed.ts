// This is a seed script to populate your Firestore 'counsellors' collection.
// IMPORTANT: You need to run this script manually from your local machine
// or a server environment that has access to your Firebase project credentials.
// It will not run automatically as part of the app.

// How to run:
// 1. Make sure you have Node.js and `ts-node` installed (`npm install -g ts-node`).
// 2. Set up Firebase Admin SDK authentication. The easiest way is to create a
//    service account key for your project:
//    - Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service accounts.
//    - Click "Generate new private key". A JSON file will be downloaded.
//    - Save this file securely in your project (e.g., at the root).
//    - **IMPORTANT:** Add the key file's name to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to version control.
// 3. Set an environment variable pointing to this key file:
//    `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"`
// 4. Update the `projectId` in the `initializeApp` call below to match your Firebase project ID.
// 5. Run the script from your terminal: `ts-node src/lib/firebase/seed.ts`

import { initializeApp, cert } from 'firebase-admin/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase-admin/firestore';

// --- IMPORTANT: CONFIGURE YOUR PROJECT ---
const serviceAccount = require('../../../your-service-account-file.json'); // Update this path

initializeApp({
  credential: cert(serviceAccount),
  projectId: 'your-firebase-project-id-here', // Update this
});
